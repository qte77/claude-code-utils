## Key Takeaways

1. **Production requires infrastructure**: 90% of effort is reliability/safety/observability, not core AI
2. **Balance training approaches**: Light Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) enables Reinforcement Learning (RL), which delivers diversity and exploration
3. **Statistical rigor in evaluation**: Small benchmarks are noisy; validate significance before claiming improvements
4. **Diversity prevents fragility**: Multi-agent leagues and varied training environments maintain robustness
5. **Security by design**: Contextual access control and channel separation are not optional for agentic systems
6. **Real-world validation matters**: Dynamic benchmarks and practical scenarios measure true capability

## 1. Production Infrastructure

**Platform Requirements:**

- Adopt AI-native platforms unifying dev, training, and inference with elasticity, observability, and failure handling
- Plan for sustained inference growth with utilization management, routing, and cost controls
- Treat compute like supply chain: multi-cloud with portable abstractions and scheduling over heterogeneous accelerators
- Modularize model interfaces to swap models and add inference-time techniques without rewriting agent logic

**Reliability & Observability:**

- Long-running agent workflows require default reliability posture
- Massive infrastructure needed beyond core AI: reliability, safety, observability
- Non-deterministic agents require new testing methods (user simulation, τ-bench)
- Standard metrics (e.g., Word Error Rate/WER) inadequate - need domain-specific quality measurements

**Advanced Capabilities:**

- Agent Data Platforms provide long-term memory and integrate with Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) for proactive, context-aware engagement
- Shift from transactional to relational agents via persistent memory systems

## 2. Training & Verification

**Training Strategy:**

- **Objective shift**: Maximize verifiable rewards via environment/tool interaction (beyond human preference alone)
- **SFT + RL balance**: Light SFT prevents meaningless attempts and enables tractable rollouts, then RL explores diverse tool-use trajectories
- **Data diversity**: Prioritize diversity across environments, tools, and verifiers (environment & verifier diversity critical)

**Verifier Design:**

- Minimize both false positives and false negatives
- Reward all equivalent correct forms while enforcing stated constraints
- Critical for post-training agentic model development

## 3. Evaluation & Benchmarking

**Core Principles:**

- Holistic strategy: Evaluate many tasks and verifiers, vary harnesses and tool action spaces
- Recognize benchmark suite defines operational notion of intelligence
- "You can only improve what gets measured"

### 3.1 Design Checklist

**Essential Criteria:**

1. **Outcome validity**: High scores genuinely reflect successful task completion (most critical)
2. **Real-world scenarios**: Practical tasks (e.g., "book a flight") over abstract puzzles
3. **Contamination resistance**: Dynamic benchmarks (DynaBench, LiveCodeBench) resist training data leakage and saturation
4. **Appropriate difficulty**: Stratified levels to differentiate capabilities
5. **Baseline provision**: Clear reference points for comparison
6. **Reproducibility**: Systematic measurement with ground truth and rigorous rubrics

**Validation Methods:**

- **Verifiable tasks**: Exact matching, test execution, database state comparison
- **Non-verifiable tasks**: Human evaluators or Large Language Model (LLM)-as-Judge with defined rubrics
- **Real artifacts**: Use actual systems (e.g., 1,507 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures/CVEs, 188 projects) not synthetic scenarios

**Common Failures:**

- Task setup flaws overestimate performance by 100% [2507.02825] ABC
- Insufficient tests (SWE-bench), degenerate solutions (TAU-bench empty responses)
- Noisy/biased data, gaming via benchmark-specific optimization
- Test/production environment mismatch

**Statistical Requirements:**

- Small benchmarks have high noise (HumanEval N=164: 2.5% gains often insignificant)
- Noise can follow Beta distribution based on model accuracy
- Large multiple-choice benchmarks (MMLU, gsm8k) have better signal-to-noise than small code benchmarks

### 3.2 Trust & Validation

**Trust Issues** [2502.06559] Trust in Benchmarks:

- Dataset biases from creation methodology
- Data contamination in training sets
- Gaming via benchmark-specific optimization
- Over-focus on text-based one-time testing (ignores multimodal/human-AI interaction)
- Misaligned incentives: State-of-the-Art (SOTA) pursuit over societal relevance

**Real-World Validation** [2506.02548] CyberGym:

- Top agents: ~20% success on real tasks vs inflated benchmark scores
- Discovered 35 zero-days, 17 incomplete patches in actual CVEs
- Proof-of-concept generation validates genuine capability

### 3.3 Consistency Metrics

**[2406.12045] τ-bench:**

- pass^k metric measures consistency across multiple trials
- GPT-4o: <50% task success, <25% pass^8 in retail domain
- Domain-specific rules critical for deployment

**[2506.07982] τ²-bench Dual-Control:**

- Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) framework tests agent-user coordination
- Performance drops significantly when users modify environment
- Fine-grained ablations separate reasoning from communication errors

### 3.4 Ecosystem Gaps

**Current State:**

- Lack of interoperability between evaluation frameworks
- Limited reproducibility across implementations
- Fragmented landscape with discovery challenges
- LLM-centric evaluations, fixed harnesses, high overhead

## 4. Multi-Agent Systems

**Coordination Patterns:**

- **League of Exploiters**: Prevents main policy over-specialization, maintains strategy diversity through adversarial training
- **Architecture**: Auto-regressive action sequences (commands + arguments) used in LLM function calling

## 5. AI Safety & Security

**Attack Surface:**

- Agentic AI has fundamentally larger attack surface than standalone LLMs
- Three expansion factors: **tools** (code/API execution), **memory** (state persistence), **autonomy** (active systems)
- Compounded vulnerabilities: all classic software vulnerabilities + new AI-specific vulnerabilities

**Prompt Injection:**

- **Root cause**: Lack of separation between control channel (system instructions) and data channel (user input)
- **Direct attacks**: Malicious user input treated as executable commands
- **Indirect attacks**: Hidden instructions in documents/webpages (e.g., white text) cause data exfiltration

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-Specific Threats:**

- **Data poisoning**: Small number of malicious documents in knowledge base triggered by specific keywords
- **Backdoor attacks**: Targeted conditional behavior changes

**Defense Strategies:**

- **Layered defense**: Guardrails and supervisors required (beyond single-layer protection)
- **Least privilege / Contextual security**: Dynamically restrict available tools and data access based on workflow context/step
- **Separation of concerns**: Isolate control and data channels where possible
