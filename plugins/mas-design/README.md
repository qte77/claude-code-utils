# mas-design

MAS plugin design and multi-framework security auditing (OWASP MAESTRO, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001/23894).

## Skills

- **designing-mas-plugins** — Design evaluation plugins following 12-Factor + MAESTRO principles
- **securing-mas** — Audit MAS security using OWASP MAESTRO, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF, and ISO 42001/23894

## Demo

Try it out after installing:

```text
/securing-mas review the current project for MAESTRO, ATLAS, and NIST AI RMF compliance
```

This will audit your multi-agent system design against four complementary
frameworks — OWASP MAESTRO (7-layer threat model), MITRE ATLAS (adversarial
TTPs), NIST AI RMF (risk governance), and ISO 42001/23894 (AI management
standards) — producing a unified threat matrix with cross-framework mappings.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin install mas-design@qte77-claude-code-utils
```
